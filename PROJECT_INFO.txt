## 🔧 KEY FUNCTIONS & FLOW

### Game Flow:
1. `createRoom()` / `joinRoom()` - Room management
2. `startNewRound()` - Determines game type, initializes round
3. `handleGameUpdate()` - Firebase listener, routes to appropriate handler
4. Round-specific handlers:
   - `handleGuessingGameUpdate()` - Manages guessing game phases
   - `handleTriviaGameUpdate()` - Manages trivia phases
   - `updateQuestionGame()` - Manages turn-based questions

### Firebase Structure:
```
games/
  [roomCode]/
    host: playerId
    players/
      [playerId]/
        name: string
        connected: boolean
        ready: boolean
    currentRound: 1-9
    gameStarted: boolean
    // Round-specific data...
```

### Key State Variables:
- `roomCode` - 4-letter room identifier
- `playerId` - Unique player ID
- `isHost` - Boolean for host privileges
- `currentGame` - Current Firebase game state
- Round-specific counters (guessingQuestionsAsked, triviaQuestionsAsked, etc.)

## 🎯 CURRENT FEATURES
- Real-time multiplayer synchronization
- No login required - just room codes
- Progress bar tracking all 54 questions
- Skip feature (3 per game) for regular questions
- Animated gradient background
- Glassmorphism UI elements
- Mobile responsive
- Round intro animations
- Score tracking for trivia rounds

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & QUIRKS
- Firebase test rules need periodic renewal
- Players must join in order (host first)
- No reconnection handling if someone refreshes
- No spectator mode
- Questions are randomly selected (may repeat across games)

## 💡 COMMON MODIFICATIONS

### Add New Questions:
```javascript
// In appropriate file (questions.js, guessing-questions.js, trivia-questions.js)
// Add to the relevant array following existing format
```

### Change Round Structure:
```javascript
// In script.js, modify GAME_STRUCTURE object
const GAME_STRUCTURE = {
    1: { type: 'guessing', name: 'Your Custom Name' },
    // etc...
};
```

### Adjust Styling:
```css
/* Main gradient in styles.css body selector */
/* Glass effect: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) with backdrop-filter */
/* Animations: @keyframes sections */
```
