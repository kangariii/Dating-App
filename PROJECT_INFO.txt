# NICE TO MEET YOU - PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
Last Updated: January 2025

## 🚀 QUICK START FOR NEW CHAT
"I have a couples game app at github.com/kangariii/Dating-App. It's a 3-round competitive game with discussion phases (this-or-that, trivia, speed categories) using Firebase. Currently working on [specific issue/feature]"

## 📍 PROJECT LINKS
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/kangariii/Dating-App
- Live Site: https://kangariii.github.io/Dating-App/
- Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dating-app-5f815

## 🏗️ TECH STACK
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Backend: Firebase Realtime Database
- Hosting: GitHub Pages
- Design: Glassmorphism with animated gradient background
- Font: Poppins (Google Fonts)

## 🎮 GAME STRUCTURE
### 3 Competitive Rounds + Discussion Phases
1. **Round 1**: This or That (10 questions with role switching)
2. **Round 2**: Trivia Challenge (7 questions)
3. **Round 3**: Speed Categories (45-second challenge)

**After each competitive round**: Winner chooses a conversation topic from 3 categories for meaningful discussion

### Game Types Explained:
- **This or That**: One player chooses between two options, partner guesses the choice. Host chooses for first 5 questions, then roles switch for remaining 5 questions.
- **Trivia**: Both answer same question simultaneously, scores tracked per round
- **Speed Categories**: Race to name items in a category within 45 seconds
- **Discussion**: Winner picks from 3 themed question categories for deeper conversation

## 🔧 KEY FUNCTIONS & FLOW

### Game Flow:
1. `createRoom()` / `joinRoom()` - Room management
2. `startNewRound()` - Determines game type, initializes round
3. `handleGameUpdate()` - Firebase listener, routes to appropriate handler
4. Round-specific handlers:
   - `handleThisOrThatGameUpdate()` - Manages this-or-that game phases
   - `handleTriviaGameUpdate()` - Manages trivia phases
   - `handleSpeedCategoriesUpdate()` - Manages speed category phases
   - `handleQuestionAnsweringPhase()` - Manages discussion phases

### Firebase Structure:
```
games/
  [roomCode]/
    host: playerId
    players/
      [playerId]/
        name: string
        connected: boolean
        ready: boolean
    currentRound: 1-3
    gameStarted: boolean
    gamePhase: instructions|playing|question-instructions|category-selection|question-answering|role-switching|complete
    overallScores: { player1: number, player2: number }
    // Round-specific data...
```

### Key State Variables:
- `roomCode` - 4-letter room identifier
- `playerId` - Unique player ID
- `isHost` - Boolean for host privileges
- `currentGame` - Current Firebase game state
- `overallScores` - Cumulative scores across all competitive rounds
- Round-specific counters (thisOrThatQuestionsAsked, triviaQuestionsAsked, etc.)

## 🎯 CURRENT FEATURES
- Real-time multiplayer synchronization
- No login required - just room codes
- Score tracking across all competitive rounds
- Role switching in This or That after 5 questions

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & QUIRKS

- Players must join in order (host first)
- No reconnection handling if someone refreshes
- No spectator mode
- Questions are randomly selected (may repeat across games)

## 💡 COMMON MODIFICATIONS

### Add New Questions:
```javascript
// In appropriate file (questions.js, this-or-that-questions.js, trivia-questions.js, speed-categories.js)
// Add to the relevant array following existing format
```

### Change Round Structure:
```javascript
// In script.js, modify GAME_STRUCTURE object
const GAME_STRUCTURE = {
    1: { type: 'this-or-that', name: 'Your Custom Name' },
    // etc...
};
```

### Adjust Styling:
```css
/* Main gradient in styles.css body selector */
/* Glass effect: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) with backdrop-filter */
/* Animations: @keyframes sections */
```
